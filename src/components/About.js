      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a final year B.Tech student specializing in <strong>Smart Manufacturing</strong> at IIIT DM Kancheepuram, with a deep passion for <strong>Software Development</strong> and full stack web technologies. While my academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in manufacturing systems, robotics, and automation, I have actively pursued my interest in web development, backend systems, and cloud computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of my studies, I have developed proficiency in programming languages like <strong>Python, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, FastAPI</strong>, and gained hands-on experience with <strong>MongoDB, AWS, and RESTful APIs</strong> through various projects and internships.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly excited about the intersection of technology and manufacturing, exploring how software solutions can drive efficiency in smart manufacturing systems. Currently, I am awaiting placement opportunities to apply my skills in the industry, and I am eager to contribute to projects that require a blend of software development and cutting-edge technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy <strong>playing video games</strong> and <strong>watching movies</strong>. These hobbies help me relax and recharge, while also sparking creativity in my work as a developer.
